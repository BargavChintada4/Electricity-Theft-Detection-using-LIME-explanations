# ‚ö° Electricity Theft Detection using Deep Learning and XAI

This repository implements **electricity theft detection** using deep learning models on **smart meter time-series data**.  
The project focuses on developing models that are not only **accurate** but also **interpretable**, by leveraging **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)**.

## üìå Project Overview
Electricity theft causes billions of dollars in losses and creates grid instability.  
This project investigates two deep learning methods for classifying consumption patterns:  
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** ‚Üí Captures sequential dependencies and sudden anomalies.  
- **Transformer (Self-Attention Model)** ‚Üí Learns long-range and global usage patterns across time.  

Both models are explained using **LIME**, which highlights the exact time intervals that influenced their predictions, ensuring **trustworthy AI-based fraud detection**.

- ‚úÖ **Evaluates Model Performance** with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and **F1-Score**.  
- ‚úÖ **Post-hoc Explanations with LIME** ‚Üí interpretable decisions for flagged theft cases.  
- ‚úÖ **Threshold Tuning** ‚Üí balances precision & recall to avoid false accusations.  
- ‚úÖ **Ready for Utility-Scale Deployment** with efficient training and explainable monitoring.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Notebooks
1. Open **LSTM_LIME_Theft.ipynb** ‚Üí Trains LSTM model + generates LIME explanations.  
2. Open **LIME_TRANSFORM_Theft.ipynb** ‚Üí Trains Transformer model + generates LIME explanations.  

Run in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.

## üìò Interpretability with LIME
- **LSTM + LIME** ‚Üí focuses on **localized events** (midnight usage spikes, drops, weekend anomalies).  
- **Transformer + LIME** ‚Üí highlights **global time patterns** (multi-day fraudulent cycles, unusual peak vs off-peak shifts).  

LIME translates model predictions into **human-understandable justifications**, crucial for utility audits and regulatory compliance.

## üìö Literature References
The project draws insights from recent explainable AI (XAI) research:  
- Frequency-domain methods like **DFT-LRP**.  
- Rule-based interpretability like **DDS-XAI**.  
- Attention models (TFT) for energy system monitoring.  
- Hybrid and neural-symbolic systems for time-series explainability.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- **LSTM** ‚Üí Higher accuracy (best for the current dataset), interprets sharp anomalies.  
- **Transformer** ‚Üí Better for large-scale and long-term fraud detection in national grids.  
- **LIME** ‚Üí Enhances transparency and trust, making models suitable for **real-world deployment**.  

This project demonstrates how combining **deep learning** with **explainability** can deliver reliable and ethical electricity theft detection.
